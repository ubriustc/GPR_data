# GPRdata
This GPR Subsurface Diagnosis (GPR-SD) dataset is collected by the Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) along the roads (cement and asphalt roads), with antennas of frequencies from 200 to 400MHZ. Each mat (GPR B-scan image) contains three GPR B-scan images collected in parallel. In each GPR image, the distance between each column (trace) is 3cm. The samples per trace are 380, and the time window is 97ns. For ease of processing, the data has been processed by MATGPR to eliminate ground echoes and gain to highlight subsurface targets. The locations of subsurface targets are roughly marked. Users can further analyze and label according to their needs. The data set will continue to be updated in the future.
